# character-form

The site was builded up by me with DOM in JS.

The flame and snow effect has been borrowed from Jon Kantner (https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/gKRKKb) and alphardex (https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/dyPorwJ).
The rest of the CSS properties was created by me.

In the HTML file there are only a <div id="root"> tag without children when the page load in, and the borrowed flame and snow elements.
