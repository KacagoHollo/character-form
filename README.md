# character-form

The site was builded up by me with DOM in JS.

The flame and snow effect has been borrowed from Jon Kantner (https://codepen.io/jkantner) and alphardex (https://codepen.io/alphardex).
The rest of the CSS properties was created by me.

In the HTML file there are only a #root div element, and the borrowed flame and snow elements.
